## The hard way-:

1. Download either of the javascript files ([`calc.js`](https://github.com/DhruvMitna/calculator/blob/master/calc.js) is recommended) (they are just different implementations of the same logic.)
2. Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.4/node-v14.17.4-x64.msi).
3. Download the folder [`node_modules`](https://github.com/DhruvMitna/calculatork/blob/master/node_modules), [`package.json`](https://github.com/DhruvMitna/calculator/blob/master/package.json) and [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/DhruvMitna/calculator/blob/master/package-lock.json)
4. Open a command prompt window into the folder

    Cd-ing into the folder-:

        1. Press `win + r` and type `'cmd'`.
        2. Type `'cd Downloads'`

    Opening cmd into the folder-:

        1. Open the **downloads** folder.
        2. Click on the address bar in the file explorer and type `'cmd'`
